/** @brief Returns the voltage of the VCC supply in millivolts (i.e. 3000 mV == 3.0 V). If running on
  *        a coin cell, this will be the battery voltage. If the ADC is not running when this function
  *        is called, it enabled the ADC briefly, and returns it to the off state.
  * @details Unlike other ADC functions, this function does not return a raw value from the ADC, but
  *          rather scales it to an actual number of millivolts. This is because the ADC doesn't let
  *          us measure VCC per se; it instead lets us measure VCC / 4, and we choose to measure it
  *          against the internal reference voltage of 1.024 V. In short, the ADC gives us a number
  *          that's complicated to deal with, so we just turn it into a useful number for you :)
  * @note This function depends on INTREF being 1.024V. If you have changed it by poking at the supply
  *       controller's VREF.SEL bits, this function will return inaccurate values.
