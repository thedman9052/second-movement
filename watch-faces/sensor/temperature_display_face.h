/*
 * THERMISTOR READOUT (aka Temperature Display)
 *
 * This watch face is designed to work with either the Temperature + GPIO
 * sensor board or the Temperature + Light sensor board. It reads the current
 * temperature from the thermistor voltage divider on the sensor board, and
 * displays the current temperature in degrees Celsius.
 *
 * When the watch is on your wrist, your body heat interferes with an ambient
 * temperature reading, but if you set it on a bedside table, strap it to your
 * bike handlebars or place it outside of your tent while camping, this watch
 * face can act as a digital thermometer for displaying ambient conditions.
 *
 * The temperature sensor watch face automatically samples the temperature
 * once every five seconds, and it illuminates the Signal indicator just
 * before taking a reading.
 *
 * Pressing the ALARM button toggles the unit display from Celsius to
 * Fahrenheit. Technically this sets the global “Metric / Imperial” flag, so
 * any other watch face that displays localizable units will display them in
 * the system selected here.
