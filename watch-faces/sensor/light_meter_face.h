 * LIGHT METER
 *
 * EXTREME WORK IN PROGRESS on a photographic light meter.
 * Currently not even remotely calibrated! I did one afternoon of tests with light
 * transmitted through the custom LCD, and half-assedly applied a curve that almost
 * not not quite entirely fit the data. Pull requests welcome!
