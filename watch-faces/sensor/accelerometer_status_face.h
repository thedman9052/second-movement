 * Accelerometer Status / Settings
 *
 * Meant to be used in conjunction with the activity_logging_face. Shows the current
 * status of the accelerometer active/still status pin, and allows adjusting the
 * motion threshold via a long press of ALARM. Note that this will not work without
 * activity_logging_face in the lineup as activity_logging_face is the one that enables
 * background accelerometer sensing.
