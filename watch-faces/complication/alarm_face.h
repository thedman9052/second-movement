/*
 * Daily ALARM face (formerly WAKE Face)
 *
 * Basic daily alarm clock face. Seems useful if nothing else in the interest
 * of feature parity with the F-91W’s OEM module, 593.
 *
 * Also experiments with caret-free UI: One button cycles hours, the other
 * minutes, so there’s no toggling between display and adjust modes and no
 * cycling the caret through the UI.
 *   º LIGHT advances hour by 1
 *   º LIGHT long press advances hour by 6
 *   º ALARM advances minute by 10
 *   º ALARM long press cycles through signal modes (just one at the moment)
