/*
 * DAYS SINCE face (previously Day One)
 *
 * This watch face displays the number of days since or until a given date.
 * It was originally designed to display the number of days you’ve been alive,
 * but technically it can count up from any date in the 20th century or the
 * 21st century, so far.
 *
 * Long press on the Alarm button to enter customization mode. The text “YR”
 * will appear, and will allow you to set the year starting from 1959. Press
 * Alarm repeatedly to advance the year. If your birthday is before 1959,
 * advance beyond the current year and it will wrap around to 1900.
 *
 * Once you have set the year, press Light to set the month (“MO”) and
 * day (“DA”), advancing the value by pressing Alarm repeatedly.
 *
 * Note that at this time, the Day One face does not display the sleep
 * indicator in sleep mode, which may make the watch appear to be
 * unresponsive in sleep mode. You can still press the Alarm button to
 * wake the watch. This UI quirk will be addressed in a future update.
